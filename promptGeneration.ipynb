      "The prompt is asking the llama3 model to identify key emotions in a given text, using pre-defined labels. Here are some suggestions to improve the prompt:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Make it more specific**: Instead of just saying \"identify key emotions\", specify what kind of emotions you want the model to detect (e.g., positive/negative emotions, basic emotions like happiness/sadness/fear, etc.).\n",
      "2. **Provide more context**: Give the model some context about the text and its emotional tone. For example, is it a romantic poem, a news article, or a social media post? This can help the model understand the nuances of human language.\n",
      "3. **Define what you mean by \"key emotions\"**: Clarify how many emotions you want the model to identify (e.g., 2-3 top emotions) and whether you're looking for specific emotions (e.g., only positive or negative).\n",
      "4. **Use more precise formatting**: Instead of asking for a JSON format with specific labels, ask for a simple list of emotions with their corresponding probabilities (e.g., [\"Happiness: 0.7\", \"Sadness: 0.3\"]).\n",
      "5. **Consider adding more guidance**: Provide examples or benchmarks to help the model understand what constitutes a good answer. This can include sample inputs and expected outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an updated prompt incorporating these suggestions:\n",
