# emotionDetectionLLM
This is a repository containing the code for the Research Project of CSE3000. The code calls Llama3 using Ollama using various prompting techniques.

# Getting started
To use the code, Ollama needs to be installed. The model LLama3 has to be pulled.

# How to run the code
Each notebook contains the prompting strategy according to their naming. By running each cell step by step, the data is converted to a dataframe, the LLM is ran locally on this dataframe and the results are converted to numpy arrays for evaluation.

It is important to note that the data is not public, so either access has to be requested or you can use your own data.
